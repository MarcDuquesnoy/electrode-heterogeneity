Electrode Heterogeneity
=========================================================
This repository contains necessary resources for the analysis of heterogeneity 
on coated NMC811 electrodes through Machine Learning.
There are 2 specific code files :
- __definition.R__ : code developed under R language to perform the 
  Principal Component Analysis and K-Means clustering for defining heterogeneity.
- __main.py__ : code developed under Python to train classifier for predicting the
  impact of manufacturing parameters.

Setup
==========================================================
In the case you need to launch Python codes inside the repository, we ask you to get a virtual environment such as conda. Go to their webpage and download it. All dependencies will be installed on your environment.

You can directly download repositories through the '.zip'. Therefore, it is possible to clone the project on your desktop in order interract with contributors, by uploading your own files. Open a Git bash and try :

```
git clone https://github.com/MarcDuquesnoy/electrode-heterogeneity.git
```
